----------------------BOOKINGS NOTES----------------------------------
Because there are 4 steps in our booking selection:
1. Choose Room
2. Choose Reason for Booking
3. Choose Time
4. Confirm
We need 4 fragments.

We are having an issue with the Fragment package.
A discrepancy between androidx and com.android
-> Fixed by migrating to AndroidX - Refactor Performed.

Try to test Booking activity
-Added XML Fragments for booking
-Added the matching inflater in the fragment.java classes
-Tested, fragments work
    - can slide between 1,2,3,4
    - with previous button disabled on step 1 (WAD)
