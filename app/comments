Because there are 4 steps in our booking selection:
1. Choose Room Size (Large/Small)
2. Choose Room (1.03, 2.03 ... )
3. Choose Reason for Booking (Formal, Study)
4. Time + Confirm (Time Slots available)
We need 4 fragments.

--------------------------------

We are having an issue with the Fragment package.
A discrepancy between androidx and com.android
-> Fixed by migrating to AndroidX - Refactor Performed.

Had a lot of issue trying to get the Dialog box to work, had to use an alternative in the end.



Try to test Booking activity
-Added XML Fragments for booking
-Added the matching inflater in the fragment.java classes
-Tested, fragments work
    - can slide between 1,2,3,4
    - with previous button disabled on step 1 (WAD)

Part 4 complete. Might not need part 5, and straight onto part 6
